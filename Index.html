    <h3 style="text-align:center">Besiktas president says club want to buy Pjanic from Barcelona</h3>
    <p style="font-size:26px">Besiktas president Ahmet Nur Cebi has said the club wants to sign midfielder Miralem
        Pjanic from Barcelona permanently as long as the price is right.<br><br>

        Pjanic moved to the Turkish side on loan in the summer after struggling for game time in his first season at the
        Camp Nou under Ronald Koeman.<br><br>

        The midfielder has played eight times for Besiktas this season, contributing four assists, and already seems to
        have convinced the club he deserves to stay.</p>

    <h3 style="text-align:center">Barcelona rumor round-up: Thiago wanted, Chelsea trio eyed & Karim Adeyemi latest</h3>
    <p style="font-size:26px">Xavi wants Thiago back at Barcelona
        Today’s rumors are already thinking about who might be the latest player to return to Barcelona after Xavi came
        back as coach and promptly snapped up Dani Alves.<br><br>

        All of which has led the rumor mill to churn out the name of Thiago, according to journalist Pedro Almeida, who
        reckons the Liverpool man is “very appreciated” by Xavi.<br><br>

        Almeida also reckons that Xavi will already have spoken to president Joan Laporta about the possibility of
        bringing Thiago back to the Camp Nou.</p>

    <h3 style="text-align:center">Dani Alves on Barcelona return: Let’s enjoy and rebuild this team we all love</h3>
    <p style="font-size:26px">Dani Alves really can’t hide his delight at being back at Barcelona for a second time
        after sealing a move back to the Camp Nou on a free transfer.
        <br><br>
        The Brazilian will join his team-mates for training next week, although he won’t be able to feature until
        January at the earlier.
        <br><br>
        Still, Alves is in typically upbeat mood and has told fans he wants to help rebuild the club.
        <br><br>
        Here’s his video message that Barcelona have put out on social media.
        <br><br>
        “Hello Culers! I’m here in Barcelona, I’m here with you guys. I’m very happy to return home,” he said. “I hope
        to see you all very soon. Let’s enjoy and rebuild this team we all love. Kisses!”</p>

    <h1 style="text-align:center">About FC Barcelona</h1>
    <p style="font-size:26px">Futbol Club Barcelona, commonly known as Barcelona and familiarly as Barca, is a
        professional football club, based in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.<br>Founded in 1899 by a group of
        Swiss,
        English and Catalan footballers led by Joan Gamper, the club has become a symbol of Catalan culture and
        Catalanism, hence the motto "Mes que un club" (More than a club). Unlike many other football clubs, the
        supporters own and operate Barcelona. It is the second most valuable sports team in the world, worth
        $3.56
        billion, and the world's second richest football club in terms of revenue, with an annual turnover of
        €560.8
        million. The official Barcelona anthem is the "Cant del Barca", written by Jaume Picas and Josep Maria
        Espinas.<button><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Barcelona">Source:</a></button>
